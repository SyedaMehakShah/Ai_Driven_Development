## What is SPECKit Plus?  
SPECKit Plus is an enhanced **Spec-Driven Development (SDD)** toolkit designed for building scalable, multi-agent AI systems. It extends specification-first development by providing structured templates and patterns that guide teams through each phase of AI-driven development, from project rules to final implementation.[web:6]

## Core Concepts of SPECKit Plus  

### 1. /constitution  
The **Constitution** phase defines the project-wide rules, standards, and constraints that every agent and service must follow. It acts like a governing rulebook that keeps the architecture consistent, enforces quality, and aligns the whole team on how decisions are made across the system.[web:7]  

### 2. /specify  
The **Specify** phase focuses on writing clear, structured specifications for features and behaviors **before coding starts**. These specs describe what the system should do, inputs/outputs, edge cases, and user expectations so that both humans and AI tools can implement features correctly.[web:9]  

### 3. /plan  
The **Plan** phase turns specifications into an actionable roadmap. It breaks the work into milestones, selects approaches or patterns, and maps which components or agents will handle which responsibilities so implementation becomes predictable and manageable.[web:9]  

### 4. /tasks  
The **Tasks** phase decomposes the plan into small, trackable tasks for developers and AI agents. Each task is concrete and executable, making it easier to coordinate work, parallelize efforts, and monitor progress across the project.[web:6][web:9]  

### 5. /implement  
The **Implement** phase is where the actual coding, integration, and testing happen according to the specs and tasks. The goal is to deliver working features that stay aligned with the original specifications.
